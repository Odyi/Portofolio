# Portofolio
First ever portofolio website i ever made, during my first months at Kuben studying IT
Apperantly some of of the photos and videos were a bit too large when i moved them here so a bunch of pictures had to be deleted and some of the rescaled so some of the images might be scuffed, this project is just to show how far i came in the span of a year it should not be seen as my full potential as a Programmer.
But i really had fun doing this project i might remake it in the future.
